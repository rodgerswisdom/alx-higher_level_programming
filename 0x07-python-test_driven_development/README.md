### Project 0x07: Python - Test-driven development
- **Description:** This project emphasizes the importance of test-driven development (TDD) in Python programming. It includes multiple tasks aimed at understanding and implementing TDD principles.
- **Lead Contributor:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Feb 8, 2024, 6:00 AM - Feb 14, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review:** 0.0/167 mandatory & 0.0/104 optional
  - Overall: 0.0%
  - Mandatory: 0.0%
  - Optional: 0.0%
  - Calculation: 0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) == 0.0%

### Concepts
- **Never forget a test:** The project emphasizes writing tests before coding and collaborating on test cases to cover all possible edge cases.

### Background Context
- Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects:
  - Documentation and tests should be written first based on task requirements.
  - Intranet checks for Python projects will be released after the first deadline to prioritize TDD and consider all cases.
  - Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases.

## Resources
- **Read or watch:**
  - [doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
  - [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
  - [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
  - [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
  - [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, learners are expected to be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- Basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- Solutions for the tasks should be developed independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism in any form is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreted/Compiled on:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **First Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md:** A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style:** Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable
- **File Length:** The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **File Endings:** All test files should end with a new line
- **Test Folder:** All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- **Test Files:** All test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`
- **Test Execution:** All tests should be executed by using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation:** All modules and functions should have documentation
- **Documentation Length:** The length of documentation will be verified
- **Collaboration:** Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases
