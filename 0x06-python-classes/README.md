# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Classes

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to Python classes as part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Curriculum Overview

The curriculum covers foundational concepts of Python programming with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python classes.

### SE Foundations
- Average Score: 66.12%
- Ongoing second chance project started on Feb 6, 2024, to end by Feb 8, 2024
- Auto QA review scheduled at the deadline

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, learners are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without external help:
- General understanding of Python programming and its advantages
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Key concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, etc.
- Data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding
- Writing Pythonic code for defining classes and handling attributes
- Utilizing properties, getters, and setters in Python
- Dynamic attribute creation and manipulation in Python
- Understanding class and instance dictionaries (__dict__)
- Attribute access in Python and usage of getattr function

### Copyright - Plagiarism
Learners are reminded of the importance of independent work and plagiarism-free submissions.

## Requirements
General requirements for the project include:
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpretation/Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Code styling: pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Documentation: All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings following Google Style Python Docstrings
- Executability: All files must be executable
- Documentation Length: The length of documentation will be verified
- Modules Documentation: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
- Classes Documentation: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
- Functions Documentation: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'

## Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python classes. Each task has its own set of requirements and objectives.

1. **My first square**
   - Define an empty class Square that represents a square.
   - No module import is allowed.

2. **Square with size**
   - Define a class Square with a private instance attribute size.
   - Size validation is not required for this task.

3. **Size validation**
   - Extend the Square class with size validation.
   - Validate size as an integer and >= 0.

4. **Area of a square**
   - Implement a public instance method area() to calculate the area of the square.
   - Size validation is required as in Task 3.

5. **Access and update private attribute**
   - Implement getter and setter for the private size attribute.
   - Perform type and value validation in the setter method.

6. **Printing a square**
   - Implement a method my_print() to print a square using '#' character.
   - Size validation is required as in Task 3.
   - If size is 0, print an empty line.

7. **Coordinates of a square**
   - Extend the Square class to include position attribute representing the square's position.
   - Position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers.
   - Modify my_print() to accommodate the position.
