## Instructions
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Use editors: vi, vim, emacs.
   - Ensure scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).

2. **Shell Scripts:**
   - Follow the specifications for each shell script in the README.md.

3. **Python Scripts:**
   - Adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style.
   - Make all Python files executable.
   - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
   - Refer to specific task instructions for details.

4. **C Scripts (if applicable):**
   - Follow the requirements for C scripts in the README.md.
   - Ensure proper inclusion of function prototypes in the header file.

5. **Project Structure:**
   - Maintain a clean and organized project structure.
   - Include a README.md file at the root of the repository with a project description.

6. **Learning Objectives:**
   - Understand Python programming fundamentals.
   - Learn about coding style using PEP8/PyCode.

7. **Avoid Plagiarism:**
   - Provide solutions independently.
   - Do not publish any content from this project.
   - Strictly adhere to the no-plagiarism policy.

8. **Questions or Help:**
