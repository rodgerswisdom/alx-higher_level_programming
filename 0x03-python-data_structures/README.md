This README provides information about a Python project related to data structures, specifically focusing on lists and tuples. The project covers various tasks related to manipulating lists and tuples in Python. Below is an overview of the README content:

### Project Overview

- **Title:** 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
- **Language:** Python (with C for some tasks)
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1

### Project Duration

The project took place from Jan 19, 2024, 6:00 AM, to Jan 23, 2024, 6:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of the project, learners are expected to be able to explain without the help of Google:

#### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What lists are and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and how to use them
- What tuples are and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- The `del` statement and how to use it

#### Copyright - Plagiarism

Learners are reminded not to copy and paste someone else’s work. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements

#### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`

#### C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of functions should be included in a header file called `lists.h`
- Don’t forget to push the header file
- All header files should be include guarded

#### Quiz Questions

The README also includes a section on quiz questions and encourages learners to keep going.

### Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each with its own set of requirements. Some example tasks include:

1. Print a list of integers
2. Secure access to an element in a list
3. Replace element in a list
4. Print a list of integers in reverse
5. Replace in a copy
6. Remove characters 'c' and 'C' from a string
7. Print a matrix of integers
8. Add two tuples
9. Return a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
10. Find the biggest integer in a list
11. Find all multiples of 2 in a list
12. Delete an item at a specific position in a list
13. Switch values of two variables in C
14. Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome in C
15. Advanced task: Create a C function to print info about Python lists

The README provides examples, expected outputs, and links to the relevant files on GitHub for each task.
