# Almost a Circle - Python Project

This project is part of the Higher Level Curriculum aimed at familiarizing you with essential concepts in Python, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), serialization, deserialization, unit testing, and more. It revolves around creating classes to represent geometrical shapes, with an emphasis on rectangles and squares.

## Background Context

The "Almost a Circle" project serves as a precursor to more complex projects like the Airbnb project within the curriculum. It delves into various aspects of Python programming, covering a wide array of topics such as file handling, exception handling, class inheritance, unit testing, and more.

In this project, you'll dive into the following Python concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Serialization and Deserialization
- Unit Testing
- JSON Handling

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be proficient in:

- Implementing unit tests for Python classes and methods
- Serializing and deserializing Python objects
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Understanding and utilizing `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python functions
- Handling named arguments in functions effectively

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Scripts must end with a newline
- The first line of all scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guide
- All files must be executable
- Documentations for modules, classes, and functions must be provided

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- Utilize the `unittest` module for testing
- Test files must be python files (extension: .py)
- Test files and folders should start with `test_`
- All tests should be executed by running `python3 -m unittest discover tests`

## Tasks Overview

This project consists of several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of Python programming. Here's a brief overview of the tasks included:

1. **SE Foundations**: Introduction to Python concepts and requirements for the project.
2. **Base Class**: Implementation of the base class with essential attributes and methods.
3. **First Rectangle**: Creation of the Rectangle class with basic functionality.
4. **Validate Attributes**: Adding attribute validation to the Rectangle class.
5. **Area First**: Implementing the method to calculate the area of a rectangle.
6. **Display #0**: Displaying rectangles using the `display()` method.
7. **__str__**: Overriding the `__str__` method for better representation.
8. **Display #1**: Enhanced display method considering x and y offsets.
9. **Update #0**: Updating attributes using positional arguments.
10. **Update #1**: Updating attributes using keyword arguments.
11. **Square Class**: Implementation of the Square class inheriting from Rectangle.
12. **Square Size**: Adding getter and setter methods for the size attribute in the Square class.
13. **Square Update**: Updating attributes of Square using arguments.
14. **Rectangle Instance to Dictionary**: Converting Rectangle instances to dictionary representation.
15. **Square Instance to Dictionary**: Converting Square instances to dictionary representation.
16. **Dictionary to JSON String**: Converting dictionaries to JSON strings.
17. **JSON String to File**: Saving JSON strings to files.
18. **JSON String to Dictionary**: Converting JSON strings back
